* neuroChessTrainer (nTrain)
is a little free Qt[fn:1] GUI manipulating backpropagation neural
networks[fn:2].  It's supposed to be fed with specific files created
by the log modes of neuroStock[fn:3] or neuroGrape[fn:4] chess
engines.  It creates/manipulates neural network files that can be used
by the neuro modes of these engines.

* Usage
During start a neural network is created with the following
characteristics: 4 layers - input with 262 neurons, hidden with 66
neurons, hidden with 256 neurons and output with 1 neuron.  Neurons
from all layers except the input have bias.  All neurons have a
sigmoid output function ranging in (-1; 1).  Network output is scaled
by 29744 which is Grapefruit's internal maximum.  Learning rate is
0.35, acceleration 0.3.  This somewhat arbitrary specification can be
changed by saving, editing and then loading the new one.

** `Train directory' file browser button
specifies directory of log files to be used.

** `Convert train files' button
converts raw .log files to .bpnl files where FEN[fn:5] notation
is recoded in 262 bits + eval number allowing slightly faster training
and assessment.  This conversion is optional and doesn't seem to give
substantial advantage.  If there is even one .bpnl file in the `Train
directory', only .bpnl files will be used for training or assessment.
Otherwise .log files will be used.

** `Save' file browser button
writes current network to file.

** `Load' file browser button
loads network from file.

** `Train' button
invokes backpropagation learning over `Train directory'.  For just in
case, in bpn~ file current state of the network is backup-ed after
each file is iterated.  On error, network state is restored from
there.

** `Epochs' spin box
specifies number of iterations over each training file.

** `Test' button
calculates mean error which the current network gives
over the files in `Train directory' and total mean error.

** `Threads' spin box
specifies number of threads to be used for training or testing of the
next neural network to be loaded.

* saved/loaded neural network files specification
Structure of these files fully specifies a neural network.  The first
line describes main characteristics and the rest - weights of all
neurons.  Elements from the first line specify respectively:

1) absolute value of range where random numbers will be used for
   initializing weights.
2) learning rate
3) acceleration
4) output scaling constant (29744 for Grapefruit, 30000 for Stockfish)
5) total number of layers including input and output
6) sequentially enumerating characteristics of the layers
   - number of neurons
   - is there bias
   - constant which specifies output function.  For now functions are:
     0 - linear
     1 - sigmoid with range (0; 1)
     2 - sigmoid with range (-1; 1)
7) if the line ends with `x' - initialization of all weights will be
   done.  This is a way of creating new networks with different
   characteristics than the default.  Weights will be initialized
   after `Load' of the file.

* Building from source
Just invoke `make' within the source directory.

* Disclaimer
neuroChessTrainer is developed and tested only on GNU/Linux so far.
